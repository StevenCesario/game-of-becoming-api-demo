# The "Streak Guardian" Core Philosophy
The system is designed to be forgiving of a single day of failure but strict about a pattern of inactivity. Its primary goal is to reframe failure not as a punishment, but as an alternative, equally valid path to progress, thereby creating positive momentum.

## Defining a "Successful Action"
A user's streak is maintained by performing a "successful action" for each working day. A successful action for a given day (e.g., Monday) can be achieved in one of three ways:

1. **The Perfect Path:** Completing Monday's Daily Intention on Monday.
2. **The Active Recovery Path:** Actively choosing to fail Monday's Daily Intention (clicking the "I can't finish" button) and then completing the resulting Recovery Quest.
3. **The Passive Recovery Path (The Grace Day):** Failing to complete Monday's Daily Intention, then logging in on Tuesday, being presented with Monday's Recovery Quest, and completing it.

## The Core Streak Logic
* **The Chain Continues:** A user's streak increases by 1 as long as there is never more than one full, inactive calendar day between successful actions. Chaining together multiple "Grace Day" recoveries is a valid way to maintain a streak.

* **The Chain Breaks:** A streak is considered broken if a user misses their "grace day." For example, if they fail on Monday, do not log in at all on Tuesday, and then log in on Wednesday, the streak is broken. Their next successful action will reset their streak to 1.

## The "Next-Day Accountability" Flow
When a user opens the app, the "Daily Check-in" process will occur:

1. The system will first check if there is an incomplete Daily Intention from the previous day.

2. **If one is found:** The user's primary task will be to complete the Recovery Quest for yesterday's intention. They will not be able to set a new intention for the current day until this is resolved. Completing this quest preserves their streak.

3. **If one is not found:** The user proceeds directly to setting their Daily Intention for the current day.
